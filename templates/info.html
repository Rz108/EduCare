    <h2>What is Stress?</h2>
    <p>
      Stress is a natural reaction to the challenges and demands of life. It can manifest as physical,
      emotional, or psychological tension. Some stress is normal and can even be helpful in certain
      situations, but chronic stress can be harmful to your health.

      Anxiety is a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear, that can be mild or severe. It's a common
      reaction to stress and can become overwhelming if not managed effectively.
